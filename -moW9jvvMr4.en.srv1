Twist What If</text><text start="200.879" dur="3.28">instead we just got really curious about</text><text start="202.599" dur="4.241">what was happening in our momentary</text><text start="204.159" dur="4.241">experience I&amp;#39;ll give you an example in</text><text start="206.84" dur="3.44">my lab we studied whether mindfulness</text><text start="208.4" dur="4.64">training could help people quit smok</text><text start="210.28" dur="4.76">smoking now just like trying to force</text><text start="213.04" dur="3.88">myself to pay attention on my breath</text><text start="215.04" dur="4.279">they could try to force themselves to</text><text start="216.92" dur="4.56">quit smoking and the majority of them</text><text start="219.319" dur="5.361">had tried this before and failed

instead focused on being curious in</text><text start="229.92" dur="5.28">fact we even told them to smoke what</text><text start="233.12" dur="3.92">yeah we said go ahead and smoke just be</text><text start="235.2" dur="5.08">really curious about what it&amp;#39;s like when</text><text start="237.04" dur="4.72">you do and what did they notice well</text><text start="240.28" dur="5">here&amp;#39;s an example from one of our</text><text start="241.76" dur="5.319">smokers she said mindful smoking smells</text><text start="245.28" dur="3.44">like stinky cheese and tastes like</text><text

she</text><text start="253.76" dur="5.479">joined our program what she discovered</text><text start="257.079" dur="7.601">just by being curiously aware when she</text><text start="259.239"

from</text><text start="335.44" dur="4.199">our habits helps us understand them in a</text><text start="337.16" dur="4.08">deeper level to know in our abone so we</text><text start="339.639" dur="3.4">don&amp;#39;t have to force ourselves to hold</text><text start="341.24" dur="3.519">back or restrain ourselves from Behavior</text><text start="343.039" dur="4.121">we&amp;#39;re just less

dur="2.921">clearly what we get when we get caught</text><text start="351.6" dur="4">up in our</text><text start="352.68" dur="5.12">behaviors becoming disenchanted on a</text><text start="355.6"

we</text><text start="363.319" dur="3.921">quit smoking but over time as we learn</text><text start="365.6" dur="4.28">to see more and more clearly the results</text><text start="367.24" dur="3.959">of our actions we let go of old habits</text><text start="369.88" dur="3.92">and form new</text><text start="371.199" dur="4.521">ones the Paradox here is that</text><text start="373.8"

dur="6.28">at helping people quit smoking so it</text><text start="450.8" dur="4.6">works and when we studied the brains of</text><text start="453.24" dur="4.28">experienced meditators we found
